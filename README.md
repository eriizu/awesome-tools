Collection of tools I would use for various projects

# Current

- [httpie](https://httpie.io/), http requests CLI helper, might be better than using cURL or electron apps that kinda suck, such as postman
- [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), noSQL database that seems better than mongo in anyway

# To try

- [meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/), document indexing and searching server
- [radicale](https://radicale.org), CalDAV and CardDAV server [docker image](https://github.com/tomsquest/docker-radicale)
- [weblate](https://weblate.org/fr/), translation and i18n platform
- [convert units](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-units/v/3.0.0-beta.3), js/ts library for converting in between units and subdivisions
- [charm go librairies](https://charm.sh/)
- [plop to create files from templates in projects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop)
